MVTec-AD Dataset Exploratory Analysis Summary
============================================================

Dataset Overview:
- Total Categories: 15
- Total Images: 5,354
- Good Images: 4,096 (76.5%)
- Defective Images: 1,258 (23.5%)
- Average Imbalance Ratio: 3.01
- Maximum Imbalance Ratio: 5.42 (in pill)

Image Properties:
- Average Image Size: 965 x 965
- Good Images Brightness (mean): 102.20
- Defective Images Brightness (mean): 106.49

Defect Analysis:
- Total Defect Types: 48
- Most Common Defect Type: color
- Category with Most Defects: pill

Key Findings:
1. The dataset exhibits significant class imbalance, with some categories having up to 5.4x more defective images than good images.
2. This imbalance likely contributed to the high false positive rate in Phase 2 model training.
3. Image sizes vary across categories, which may require careful resizing strategies.
4. Defective images show different brightness characteristics compared to good images.

Recommendations for Model Training:
1. Implement class balancing techniques (weighted loss, balanced sampling)
2. Optimize decision threshold to reduce false positives
3. Consider category-specific approaches for highly imbalanced categories
4. Use data augmentation to address class imbalance
